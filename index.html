            Greetings! My name is Scrooge McDuck, and you are visiting my professional portfolio. Why would I, an extremely rich buisness owner and entrepreneur, need a very basic portfolio website, you may ask? Well one of the many things I have learned over my very successful life, is that you never turn down an opportunity to market yourself. If you are looking for someone who never turns down self-promotion, then look no feather!
        </br>

            In my free time, I like to hang out with my nephew Donald and his kids: Huey, Dewey, and Louie. They really quack me up with their hijinks! I'm also starting to get into the TV game. I recently got the green light on a pilot episode I'm executive producing with Dick Wolf called "Fowl Play", which is basically "Law and Order", but all of the characters are ducks. I also like jumping into piles of my money. You know, the usual rich guy things.
        </br>

            In my buisness, things migrate fast. I'm always looking to stay one webbed foot ahead. That's why I started this site, so I can invest in YOUR ideas! Contact me for any buisness opportunities you may have. That way, you can foot ME with the bill!
