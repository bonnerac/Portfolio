# Portfolio

## Desciption

This project is a portfolio site using HTML and CSS following a set of specifications and a style guide. 

## Goals

This site is designed to showcase someone's professional portfolio. It includes the following pages:

* **About** section - To introduce this person to visitors of the site, especially professionals in a similar or related industry
* **Portfolio** section - To showcase this person's work to potential employers, or anyone with an interest in the subject
* **Contact** section - To allow any of the website's visitors to contact this person directly, especially for inquiring about employment or freelancing opportunities

## Complications

While completeing this project, I ran into several complications. Seeing how this was my first major coding/web development project, this wasn't suprising to me, but did lead to some frustration. These included:

* Putting in the small lines in-between the links on the navigation bar
* Had an issue where the body section of the index page was stuck behind the nav bar
* In the **Portfolio** section, adding the titles that lay on top of the pictures
    * This took a long time, with a lot of trial and error. The inspector tool in Google Chrome was especially helpful making adjustments and finding problem areas in my code.


## Other Thoughts

You may have noticed that this is a professional portfolio site for Scrooge McDuck. I picked Mr. McDuck because he is a very interesting individual, yet he has no professional portfolio website that I could find on the internet. I figured he could use one. This lack of internet presence is most likely due to the fact that he is a duck as well as a fictional character.
